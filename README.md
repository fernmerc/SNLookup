# SNLookup
iOS App that fetches SNs from SIDs

Due to complications with the camera framework I had to implement MLKit using the photo library, so there must be dowloaded images of code128 format barcodes in order for the "scanning" functionality to work.

Error detection and status code handling is present and invalid inputs are prevented.
